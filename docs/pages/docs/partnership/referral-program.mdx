# Referral program

## What is the Enum referral program and why it may be crucial for your business

The referral program allows you to increase your limits (on usage and loaded pages) without spending a cent. It is very straightforward: you create and share your referral code and as soon as someone buys a subscription you and your referee get 20%(!!!) of *your referee's plan* additional limits. Let's see in detail how to set up the referral, and answer the very frequently asked questions.

#### Why to participate?

Participating in Enum's referral program offers a multitude of benefits that can significantly enhance your experience and capabilities within our platform. Here are some compelling reasons why you should get involved:

##### 1. **Increase Your Usage Limits for Free**
By referring new users to Enum, you can increase your usage limits without spending a cent. For every successful referral, both you and your referee receive an additional 20% of the referee's plan limits. This means more messages, more data, and more opportunities to leverage Enum's powerful features.


##### 2. **Be a Part of Our Growth**
Your participation in the referral program helps us grow and improve. By bringing in new users, you contribute to the expansion of our community, which in turn allows us to invest more in developing new features and enhancing our services.

##### 3. **Easy to Share**
Our referral program is designed to be straightforward and user-friendly. Creating and sharing your referral code is simple, and you can distribute it through various channels such as social media, personal or corporate blogs, email, or even word of mouth. The more you share, the more you stand to gain.

##### 4. **No Cap on Limits**
Unlike many other programs, Enum's referral program does not have a cap on the limits you can earn. This means the sky's the limitâ€”literally. The more you refer, the higher your limits can go, providing you with unparalleled flexibility and capacity.

##### 5. **Secure and Transparent**
We value transparency and security. You will receive an email notification every time your limits are increased due to a successful referral. You can easily track your progress and see the impact of your referrals in real-time.

##### 6. **Risk-Free Participation**
There is no downside to participating in our referral program. If a referee cancels their subscription, your limits will be adjusted accordingly, but you will not lose any of your original plan limits. Plus, if they resubscribe, your limits will be increased again.


## How it works

<Steps>
  ### Create your referral code
  Navigate to the *Settings* menu and click the *Partnership* item:

<Callout>
  Please select a referral code that is easy to copy and share. Remember, it's case-sensitive! We do not recommend adding spaces and other punctuation marks except dashes because it's easy to confuse them.

If such a code is already in use by other users, you will see the error:

Before saving your referral code, please read and agree to the [Referral Program Terms And Conditions](https://enumhq.com/referral-terms) and then click the corresponding checkbox:



### Share your referral code 
You can share your code with your partners, colleagues, friends, followers, your dentist, chiropractor, your kids' camp... whatever could be useful!

### Your referee buys the subscription
If someone doesn't have an Enum account, they should create it, hopefully, they try our chatbot and love it, so they decided to buy a subscription... right after they select a plan, they can enter your referral code:

Before proceeding this step, they can click the *Check this referral code* to make sure the code exists:

If the code doesn't exist, they will see the corresponding message...

## The frequently asked questions on the referral program

### How exactly is the new limit calculated?
If you are a referral: we give you an additional 20% of *your referee's plan limits*.
Say, if your referee's plan has 1,000 messages a month and your plan's limit is 100, your limit will be 100 (your plan limit) + 200 (20% of your referee limit) = 300 messages a month.

### If my account is free, can I still create a referral code?
Yes, you can! If you have many referees, your limits can be as high as those for a paid plan.

### What happens when my referee cancels their subscription?
Unfortunately, if they cancel their subscription, your limits will be decreased by 20% (of your referee's plan limit). However, your limit will be raised if they change their mind and subscribe again.

### Does it matter to me which exact plan my referee buys?
It doesn't matter to you as your increase is always calculated based on *your* limits, not theirs.

### Do you have a cap or a ceiling for limits?
In theory, we don't! At least, now. 

### Why have you started this program, if you lose money?
Yes, we lose a bit on every referee but finding new users and getting new subscriptions are much more important and valuable for us. This is why we start this program.

### May you stop this program?
We can stop it any moment but your current earned limits should be left unchanged.
