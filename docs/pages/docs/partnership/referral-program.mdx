# Referral program

## What is the Enum referral program and why it may be crucial for your business

The referral program allows you to increase your limits (on usage and loaded pages) without spending a cent. It is very straightforward: you create and share your referral code and as soon as someone buys a subscription you and your referee get 10% additional limits. Let's see in detail how to set up the referral, and answer the very frequently asked questions.

## How it works

<Steps>
  ### Create your referral code
  Navigate to the *Settings* menu and click the *Partnership* item:

  In the corresponding field, enter *some* code and save the settings:

<Callout>
  Please select a referral code that is easy to copy and share. Remember, it's case-sensitive! We do not recommend adding spaces and other punctuation marks except dashes because it's easy to confuse them.

If such a code is already in use by other users, you will see the error:

### Share your referral code 
You can share your code with your partners, colleagues, friends, followers, your dentist, chiropractor, your kids' camp... whatever could be useful!

### Your referee buys the subscription
If someone doesn't have an Enum account, they should create it, hopefully, they try our chatbot and love it, so they decided to buy a subscription... right after they select a plan, they can enter your referral code:

Before proceeding this step, they can click the *Check this referral code* to make sure the code exists:

If the code doesn't exist, they will see the corresponding message...

... and double-check for it.

### You will get an email about increasing your limits

### Both of you, check your limits!

Navigate to the *Usage/Limits* page on the left menu:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acd91961-b31b-4005-a2b2-598fe94174da)

Now, you see that your limits were raised! It may be not so much but *"Many a mickle makes a muckle"* :) so, keep going! There is not cap in limits, seriously!

And your information on the partnership is updated:

The same page for your referee looks like this:

And here are their current limits:

</Steps>

## The frequently asked questions on the referral program

### How exactly is the new limit calculated?
We always give you an additional 10% of *your plan*, not your current limits.
Say, if your plan has 1,000 messages a month, and you have 3 referees then your limit will be 1,300 messages a month.

### If my account is free, can I still create a referral code?
Yes, you can! If you have many referees, your limits can be as high as those for a paid plan.

### What happens when my referee cancels their subscription?
If they cancel their subscription, unfortunately, your limits were decreased by 10% (of your plan's limit). But if they change their mind and subscribe again, your limit will be raised.

### Does it matter to me which exact plan my referee buys?
It doesn't matter to you as your increase is always calculated based on *your* limits, not theirs.

### Do you have a cap or a ceiling for limits?
In theory, we don't! At least, now. 

### Why have you started this program, if you lose money?
Yes, we lose a bit on every referee but finding new users and getting new subscriptions are much more important and valuable for us. This is why we start this program.

### May you stop this program?
If we see there is no value in this program, we will stop it.
