# Referral program

## What is the Enum referral program and why it may be crucial for your business

The referral program allows you to increase your limits (on usage and loaded pages) without spending a cent. It is very straightforward: you create and share your referral code and as soon as someone buys a subscription you and your referee get 10% additional limits. Let's see in detail how to set up the referral, and answer the very frequently asked questions.

## How it works

<Steps>
  ### Create your referral code
  Navigate to the *Settings* menu and click the *Partnership* item:

  In the corresponding field, enter *some* code and save the settings:

<Callout>
  Please select a referral code that is easy to copy and share. Remember, it's case-sensitive! We do not recommend adding spaces and other punctuation marks except dashes because it's easy to confuse them.

If such a code is already in use by other users, you will see the error:

### Share your referral code 
You can share your code with your partners, colleagues, friends, followers, your dentist, chiropractor, your kids' camp... whatever could be useful!

### Your referee buys the subscription
If someone doesn't have an Enum account, they should create it, hopefully, they try our chatbot and love it, so they decided to buy a subscription... right after they select a plan, they can enter your referral code:

Before proceeding this step, they can click the *Check this referral code* to make sure the code exists:

If the code doesn't exist, they will see the corresponding message...

... and double-check for it.

### You will get the email about increasing your limits

### Both of you, check your limits!

Navigate to the *Usage/Limits* page on the left menu:

Now, you see that your limits were raised! It may be not so much but *"Many a mickle makes a muckle"* :) so, keep going! There is not cap in limits, seriously!

And your information on the partnership is updated:

The same page for your referee looks like this:

And here are their current limits:
