# Why install and use Enum for your business and projects
We created Enum to help you with assisting your users after hours. If you can't sit at your computer for 24 hours, AI can. If you can't find the answer fastly, the AI can.

## AI at your service

### Load your own documents
You can load textual information, a whole website, and PDF files. All the information is indexed, split into chunks, and store in the database for fast search context that then will be used by ChatGPT for answering the questions.

### Include the links in the response
When the chatbot responds it may include the links to the source web pages with the relevant information.

### Conversational AI
Now, the chatbot remembers the context and can keep the conversation. Formally, it can access the latest 5 pairs of "question-answer". So far, this was pretty enough. But let us know if you think it should be the longer list.

### Modern models are available
For the "Key" plan you can choose, which GPT model to use: now GPT-3 and GPT-4 are available. For all other plans, GPT-3 is available.

### Custom prompts
You can use your own prompt that can replace or supplement the default one. 

## Customization
Add the chatbot name (available for paid plans), and change the default icon (available for all the plans).

## Seamless integration with Crisp

### Automation
The best thing with Enum chatbot is that you should not install two different chatboxes - one for AI, and another one for live agents. All of them can use the same chatbox: when you are online, you disable the AI and answer questions on your own; after hours you enable the chatbot; but you can enable it even when you are online, let the chatbot answer common questions, and join the conversation when a user needs human help - then the chatbot will be turned off automatically (you can re-run the session from our UI).

### Work with Crisp Triggers side-by-side
If you use [the Crisp Triggers plugin](https://help.crisp.chat/en/article/how-to-use-triggers-pq0znd/) you can say the Enum chatbot to wait for N seconds and, if not Trigger answered the user's question, answer on its own. This logic prevents racing with Triggers and duplicate responses.

## Great support
We are ready to answer your questions no matter if you are on a free or paid plan. All customers are the same valuable to us. When we are out of the office, our own chatbot may help.
