# Why install and use Enum for your business and projects
We created Enum to help you with assisting your users after hours. If you can't sit at your computer for 24 hours, AI can. If you can't find the answer fastly, the AI can.

## Easy installing and using
All you need to do to start using the Enum chatbot is to register at Enum and install the Crisp plugin, the chatbot will be automatically added to your project (an entity where you store your data along the chatbots and settings, is created automatically too).

### Live testing
Before publishing the chatbot on your website, you can live-test it right in the Enum dashboard.

## AI at your service

### Load your own documents
You can load textual information, a whole website, and PDF files. All the information is indexed, split into chunks, and stored in the database for fast search context that then will be used by ChatGPT for answering the questions.

### Include the links in the response
When the chatbot responds it may include the links to the source web pages with the relevant information.

### Conversational AI
Now, the chatbot remembers the context and can keep the conversation. Formally, it can access the latest 5 pairs of "question-answer". So far, this was pretty enough. But let us know if you think it should be the longer list.

### Language support
Extensive language support, including automatic language detection and the ability to communicate in 107 languages

### Custom buttons

## Seamless integration with Crisp

### Easy Installation and Automation
The best thing with Enum chatbot is that you should not install two different chatboxes - one for AI, and another one for live agents. All of them can use the same chatbox: when you are online, you disable the AI and answer questions on your own; after hours you enable the chatbot; but you can enable it even when you are online, let the chatbot answer common questions, and join the conversation when a user needs human help - then the chatbot will be turned off automatically (you can re-run the session from our UI).

Also, your chatbot can re-run again when you or your user resolve the conversation.

### Work with Crisp Triggers side-by-side
If you use [the Crisp Triggers plugin](https://help.crisp.chat/en/article/how-to-use-triggers-pq0znd/) you can say the Enum chatbot to wait for N seconds and, if not Trigger answered the user's question, answer on its own. This logic prevents racing with Triggers and duplicate responses.

### Integration with other channels that are integrated into Crips
Currently, you can with just one click integrate these channels:

- Aircall
- Email
- Facebook
- Instagram
- Telegram
- Twilio
- WhatsApp

We are ready to answer your questions no matter if you are on a free or paid plan. All customers are the same valuable to us. When we are out of the office, our chatbot may help.
