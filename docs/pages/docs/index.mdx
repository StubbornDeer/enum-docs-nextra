# Enum

**Enum** is a tool to explore, research, and ask questions about your data from any source - plain text, files, and websites. Right now, you can use it as:

- standalone web application and ask questions via our user interface
- a smart chatbot that can be integrated easily into your Crisp chatbox to help your users when you are offline.

## Quick Start

import { Card, Cards } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

The very first step to start working with Enum is to register.
