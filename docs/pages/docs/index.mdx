# Enum

**Enum** is a tool to explore, research, and ask questions of your data from any source - plain text, files, websites, and more. 

## Quick Start

import { Card, Cards } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

The very first step to start working with Enum is to register.

{/*<Cards num={2}>
  <Card image arrow title="Documentation theme" href="/docs/docs-theme/start">
    <>![Documentation theme](/assets/docs-theme.png)</>
  </Card>
  <Card image arrow title="Blog theme" href="/docs/blog-theme/start">
    <>![Blog theme](/assets/blog-theme.png)</>
  </Card>
</Cards>*/}
