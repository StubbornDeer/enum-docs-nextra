# Installing the chatbot Crisp plugin

## What is Crisp?

[Crisp](https://crisp.chat) is an all-in-one business messaging platform that gathers teams, conversations, data and knowledge in one place.

## What is the Support AI ChatBot plugin?

We created this plugin to allow your users and visitors to ask questions on your website about your company, product, and any other materials and data without the need for you to be there.

What are the benefits?

1. You don't have to be at your computer 24/7, without the risk of losing customers.
2. Our chatbot can answer questions much faster than you would.
3. Our chatbot can answer questions in a more precise manner.
4. Our chatbot is based on ChatGPT (currently) so it's much smarter than a usual chatbot.
5. The chatbot knowledge is only limited by the guides, materials, and any other documentation you provide.

To run the chatbot you don't need to create long, unreliable workflows. All you need is to simply register at [Enum](https://enumhq.com), upload files and/or scrape your own website. You also need to install this plugin, of course.

So, here is the full guide on installing and running your smart chatbot:

  <Callout>
  Please note 2 parameters that are being passed to the Enum dashboard: website_id and token. Both parameters are available for Enum only during this plugin installation so it's crucially important to finish the login/registration process. These parameters will be used to identify you as the Crisp website owner and nobody else will not have access to your data.
