### General settings
Here, you can control the availability of the chatbot and whether to include the links to the responses.

#### Disable the plugin temporarily

Selecting this option disables the AI bot, so you can speak to your customers without its interruptions.

#### Data source information
If you want the chatbot to include the most relevant links in its response, check the *Show source links in response* checkbox.
<Callout>
This checkbox is turned off by default.
</Callout>

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/59aeb457-fe43-4eb3-a9be-85f402c633db)


This is how the response with links looks:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/03342743-2538-42df-890e-7c4e8f291c65)


<Callout>Please note, we provide only the links but Crisp chatbox renders the first one based on the metatags that can be found on the webpage.</Callout>

We include 5 found links, the first one is marked as "Source", and others as "Additional sources" - by default. The titles are automatically translated into the user's language:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/dfd9aa31-5ade-476f-aef8-5df7bd6291c0)

You can change the number of shown links:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/0a88c336-9e24-444e-86a0-5483d78563dc)

Both numbers could be zero, and no links will be shown. By default, if you don't change this setting, we show 1 main link and 3 additional links.

#### Collect button click statistics
You can select this option to allow our system to collect the stats on the button clicks.

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/8e3181d0-afe1-45d4-b468-291121dbc98e)

You can review the statistics for your project in [the corresponding tab]().

### Widget settings
Here, you specify how your chatbot and its responses look:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/01019f79-136d-400b-99e0-d6262904c891)


#### Chatbot icon

  You may choose from 3 options:
  
  - the default Crisp userpic
  - a "cute" Enum robot userpic
  - your own URL to a userpic.
  
  Default Crisp userpic:
  
![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/5a903c4f-f974-45e6-96fd-aed450d30ac5)

  
  a cute robot:
  
![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/8f669673-8ed4-4646-b89a-7281b4362766)

  
  your own URL:
  
![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/e57db858-3b7d-44be-8a5d-91a24645ffbf)

#### Chatbot name
This name is shown as grey text beside the chatbot's icon. You may leave it empty or enter your chatbot/company name.

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/9c6306a6-ff8f-4572-b86f-ab247c503d01)

### Custom behaviour & Automation

Here are 4 sections, all collapsed by default:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/1aa3e301-d21a-4a7c-80d6-2e85f4cd95cc)


#### Chatbot in session
Here you define your chatbot's automatic behaviour during the sessions:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/bd878ab0-4dbc-4a6d-aeb6-70674cf3dbba)


1. *Pause the chatbot when agent joins the conversation*

If this checkbox is checked, then every time when you or your agents join a conversation with the chatbot, the chatbot will be quiet.

<Callout>
All the paused sessions can be found on the *Paused sessions* tab, more information is below. To re-run the session in semi-automatic mode, use the next option.
</Callout>

2. *Re-run chatbot when conversation is resolved*

This indicates to re-run the chatbot when you click the "Mark this conversation as resolved" in the Crisp dashboard:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/12941fcf-34e9-4449-b81b-bc3a03fa1d29)


3. *Send this message when re-running chatbot*

It's a good idea to let your user know that the chatbot is running again so they can enjoy your support 24/7.


#### User requests human assistance
Specify what the chatbot should do when user wants to talk to human beings.

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/a17221dd-3dc2-4a3e-b704-1a50c8fe5780)


1. *Send this message when user requests for human*

  Enter a message you want to be sent to the chat when a user requests human assistance. Usually, it's just a piece of information that humans will join the conversation soon.

2. *Pause the chatbot when user requests human assistance*

Turn this checkbox on if you want the chatbot to be quiet after a user requests for assistance.

4. *Notify me when user requests assistance*

Currently, you can only send email(s) to notify you that somebody waits for you (we will add more notification channels in the future).

To add an email, click the "Add a notification" button, enter email, and press the Return button.

Here is the example notification sent by email:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/5cfe7f85-59ad-432d-9c21-8f597e06f353)


#### Coordinate the chatbot with Crisp Triggers
If you use Crisp triggers, you may consider using these options to avoid duplicating answers (from triggers and the chatbot).

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/4057fe35-3a67-47da-88f2-123dc0ac879c)

1. *Wait for Crisp Trigger response*
Check this option to make the chatbot wait for the trigger's response. If not checked, the chatbot will answer without waiting.

2. *Wait time (in seconds) for Crisp Trigger response*
Specify how many seconds to wait. From our experience, 4 seconds is good but you may find it too fast or too slow, depending on your trigger's parameters.

#### Add standard action buttons to the messages

You can add several buttons to your messages. Below each option, there are preview buttons where you can see how they would look in your chatbox.

<Callout>
  Please note, that if you show a button, it **must** have a text label (Crisp doesn't allow buttons without text). So, if you remove the text from a field, the default label will be used instead.
</Callout>

This is how the buttons look for a user:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/7ef6f23e-c2fc-4513-bd6e-90ab6efe8d81)


##### 1. Feedback buttons
They allow a user to give your chatbot feedback: good or bad. You can enter your own text labels for both buttons:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/3af03f25-ae0e-4513-9144-0881fc5f360c)

In your Crisp dashboard, you will see the feedback:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/a6032ef0-0819-459b-a6a5-19df6254a091)


##### 2. Mark resolved button
This button allows a user to mark the conversation resolved (or closed). 

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/448ddd20-d3c8-4cbc-81c3-8ada95b1eea5)

When a user clicks the button, it's resolved what you see in your Crisp dashboard:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/3fa88034-f647-42e5-b1b9-2decb1af4553)

##### 3. Request a human operator

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/de7e2095-056f-403f-af46-db5af6d8608f)

When a user clicks this button, the corresponding response and notification will be sent if you set them up as described [here](https://www.enumhq.com/docs/chat-plugins/crisp/crisp-settings#user-requests-human-assistance).

<Callout>
  Sometimes you can see the colorful icons, sometimes not. It all depends on the browser. For example, in Firefox it will look differently:
  
  
  ![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/94287b28-295c-42f7-bbb6-d4c1e4c21bfe)

</Callout>

#### Automation based on a schedule
You can specify the time slots where you want the chatbot to be quiet or active. Click the *Open schedule calendar* to create a schedule:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/aa2ab4d5-9a4b-4653-9eee-5527bb4d6063)

You will the calendar:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/e4c95d42-19eb-4bcb-a7a3-0ea4333db1ea)

First, decide if you want to specify the timeslots for your chatbot to be active, or paused (select what is less), then double-click in the corresponding place to create a time slot.
Specify the parameters for your time slot:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/ecf1ae27-a1e3-4c4f-880e-f2160b71f24d)

To create a series of similar timeslots, just select the *Repeat* value for the corresponding dropdown and specify the recurrency parameters. After you've done it, save the settings and your calendar will be updated. You can change the action for the timeslots as well as the series parameters - just double-click on a time slot. 

Also, you can change a separate slot: use your mouse to drag the start and end, or double-click to change the parameters.

Here, an example of the schedule:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/aa5287df-1d0c-45b9-af04-f05650de7733)

Click the *Ok* to close the schedule window, then the *Save changes* button.

#### Integration with Crisp chatbot workflow

If you want that the chatbot doesn't start answering immediately, you may pause it until it gets the corresponding signal. The signal can be sent by the Crisp chatbot as described in the article [about the integration of Enum and Crisp chatbots](https://www.enumhq.com/docs/chat-plugins/crisp/crisp-chatbot-integration).

If don't want such behavior leave the default option (the first one) as is:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/f3f7b830-5909-4aec-9098-1183cd4149a8)


### Paused sessions

Here you will see data regarding any chat sessions in which AI has been deactivated due to an agent joining the conversation (if you have the setting toggled on).

![](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/6e0b35a3-6119-42b1-a7fd-6a32608238c8)



Use the chat page button to jump into the active chat inside Crisp:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/931a5c90-bdd4-4dab-b540-805dc8fc1e33)



Click "Run again" to reactive the AI in the paused session:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/b6ab0205-79c9-45e3-a437-6dbd1b3f2380)


The AI will resume answering questions; however, if you join the conversation again, the AI chatbot will be deactivated again.

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/0eb4d116-c527-46bd-9fc8-c41d4b97f72e)

### The live test
You can test your chatbot right from the Enum dashboard before exposing it to the public. Just click the *Show Crisp chatbox button* and you will see the button on the right bottom corner (wait several seconds if it does not appear immediately). Click on it and interact in the same way as if it's placed on your website.

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/37721f71-adf2-4be3-8b4c-e226f819f46b)

Here, you also can specify whether you want the chatbot to run everywhere or only here, in this test environment. By default, this switch is off but if you set it on, the chatbot will work only here. 

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/784b6f25-5b80-48a1-b228-527f0b4849e2)


<Callout>
This setting is very helpful if you already have your Crisp chatbox installed and you want to test the chatbot before making it production available.
