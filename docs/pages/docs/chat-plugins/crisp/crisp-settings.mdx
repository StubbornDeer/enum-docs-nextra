#### Data source information

<Callout>
This checkbox is turned off by default.
</Callout>

<Callout>Please note, we provide only the links but Crisp chatbox renders the first one based on the metatags that can be found on the webpage.</Callout>

We include 5 found links, the first one is marked as "Source", and others as "Additional sources". The titles are automatically translated into the user's language:
