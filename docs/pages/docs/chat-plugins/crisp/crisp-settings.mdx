### General settings
Here, you can control the availability of the chatbot and whether to include the links to the responses.

#### Data source information
If you want the chatbot to include the most relevant links in its response, check the *Show source links in response* checkbox.
<Callout>
This checkbox is turned off by default.
</Callout>
This is how the response with links looks:

<Callout>Please note, we provide only the links but Crisp chatbox renders the first one based on the metatags that can be found on the webpage.</Callout>

We include 5 found links, the first one is marked as "Source", and others as "Additional sources". The titles are automatically translated into the user's language:

1. *Pause the chatbot when agent joins the conversation*

If this checkbox is checked, then every time when you or your agents join a conversation with the chatbot, the chatbot will be quiet.

<Callout>
All the paused sessions can be found on the *Paused sessions* tab, more information is below. To re-run the session in semi-automatic mode, use the next option.
</Callout>

2. *Re-run chatbot when conversation is resolved*

This indicates to re-run the chatbot when you click the "Mark this conversation as resolved" in the Crisp dashboard:

3. *Send this message when re-running chatbot*

It's a good idea to let your user know that the chatbot is running again so they can enjoy your support 24/7.


#### User requests human assistance
Specify what the chatbot should do when user wants to talk to human beings.

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/7454e7f6-4496-4656-bc64-c3aa34850b16)

1. *Send this message when user requests for human*

  Enter a message you want to be sent to the chat when a user requests human assistance. Usually, it's just an information that humans will join the conversation soon.

2. *Notify me when user requests assistance*

Currently, you can only send email(s) to notify you that somebody waits for you (we will add more notification channels in the future).

To add an email, click the "Add a notification" button, enter email, and press the Return button.

Here is the example notification sent by email:

#### Coordinate the chatbot with Crisp Triggers
If you use Crisp triggers, you may consider using these options to avoid duplicating answers (from triggers and the chatbot).

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/4057fe35-3a67-47da-88f2-123dc0ac879c)

1. *Wait for Crisp Trigger response*
Check this option to make the chatbot wait for the trigger's response. If not checked, the chatbot will answer without waiting.

2. *Wait time (in seconds) for Crisp Trigger response*
Specify how many seconds to wait. From our experience, 4 seconds is good but you may find it too fast or too slow, depending on your trigger's parameters.


### Paused sessions

Here you will see data regarding any chat sessions in which AI has been deactivated due to an agent joining the conversation (if you have the setting toggled on).

Click "Run again" to reactive the AI in the paused session:

The AI will resume answering questions; however, if you join the conversation again, the AI chatbot will be deactivated again.
