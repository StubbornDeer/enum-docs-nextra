### General settings
Here, you can control the availability of the chatbot and its automatic behavior.

#### Disable the plugin temporarily

Selecting this option disables the AI bot, so you can speak to your customers without its presence.

#### Data source information
If you want the chatbot to include the most relevant links in its response, check the *Show source links in response* checkbox.
<Callout>
This checkbox is turned off by default.
</Callout>
This is how the response with links looks:

<Callout>Please note, we provide only the links but Crisp chatbox renders the first one based on the metatags that can be found on the webpage.</Callout>

We include 5 found links, the first one is marked as "Source", and others as "Additional sources". The titles are automatically translated into the user's language:

<Callout>Attention! These settings were moved to the project's.</Callout>

#### Chatbot automation
Use the *Turn the chatbot off when an agent joins the conversation* checkbox to provide the pausing of the chatbot as soon as an agent joins the conversation.

<Callout>
This checkbox is turned on by default.
</Callout>

All the paused sessions can be found on the *Paused sessions* tab, more information is below.

#### Waiting for Crisp Triggers
If you use the Crisp Trigger, you may want to ask the chatbot to wait for N seconds (4, by default) - in this case, if a trigger is fired and sends its message to the user's chatbox, the chatbot will not respond at all. It allows you to avoid sending duplicate messages.

### Widget settings
Here, you specify how your chatbot and its responses look:

Here you will see data regarding any chat sessions in which AI has been deactivated due to an agent joining the conversation (if you have the setting toggled on).



Use the chat page button to jump into the active chat inside Crisp:

The AI will resume answering questions; however, if you join the conversation again, the AI chatbot will be deactivated again.
