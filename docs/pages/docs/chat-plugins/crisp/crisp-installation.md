# Installing the chatbot Crisp plugin

## What is Crisp?

[Crisp](https://crisp.chat) is an all-in-one business messaging platform that gathers teams, conversations, data and knowledge in one place.

## What is the Support AI ChatBot plugin?

We created this plugin to allow your users and visitors to ask questions on your website about your company, product, and any other materials and data without the need for you to be there.

What are the benifits?

1. You don't have to be at your computer 24/7, without the risk of losing customers.
2. Our chatbot can answer the questions much faster than you would.
3. Our chatbot can answer the questions in more precise manner.
4. Our chatbot is based on ChatGPT (currently) so it's much smarter than a usual chatbot.

To run the chatbot you don't need to create long, unreliable workflows. All you need is to simply register at [Enum](https://enumhq.com), upload files and/or scrape your own website. You also need to install this plugin, of course.

So, here is the full guide on installing and running your smart chatbot:
