### Disable the plugin temporarily

Selecting this option disables the AI bot, so you can speak to your customers without its presence.

1. Translate chatbot responses.
   - If a customer asks a question in a foreign language, the chatbot will reply in the respective language if setting is activated.
   
3. Turn the chatbot off when an agent joins the conversation
   - If toggled on, this setting will deactive the AI from the customer session, if an agent joins the conversation, allowing you to communicate to customers without the AI present.
