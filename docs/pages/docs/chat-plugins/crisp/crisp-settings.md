### Disable the plugin temporarily

Selecting this option disables the AI bot, so you can speak to your customers without its presence.

2. Is asked to talk to a human.

1. Translate chatbot responses.
   - If a customer asks a question in a foreign language, the chatbot will reply in the respective language if setting is activated.
   
3. Turn the chatbot off when an agent joins the conversation
   - If toggled on, this setting will deactive the AI from the customer session, if an agent joins the conversation, allowing you to communicate to customers without the AI present.

Here you will see data regarding any chat sessions in which AI has been deactivated due to an agent joing the conversation (if you have the setting toggled on)
