# Integration with the Crisp chatbot plugin

## Why to integrate?
The Crisp chatbot is a pretty powerful tool and may add logic to the chatbox's behavior. For example, it may answer simple questions, show buttons depending on the user's message, and so on. You can read more about its functionality in the [official documentation](https://crisp.chat/en/chatbot/).

On the other hand, it has huge restrictions as it's not an AI-based chatbot. But by combining its functionality with the Enum chatbot, you may have more control over the chatbox and create pretty complicated workflows.

## Example of integration

### Problem definition
Let's review such a case (based on the real requirements): a company has 2 groups of users that can be divided by their proficiency: new users usually ask simple questions that the Enum chatbot can answer easily whereas experienced users that are on an advanced plan may ask questions that a human agent could only answer.

The first scenario would look in this way:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/b5f8e5bb-ad98-4bc5-9f8f-f54846b2fe25)


Here is how the second scenario should look in the chatbox:

### Possible Solution
We want our new users to be served by a chatbot whereas the advanced users could choose who/what they would prefer to talk to - the AI assistant or a human agent. To distinguish between them, we use conversation tags, or segments (more on Crisp's segments read in [this article](https://help.crisp.chat/en/article/what-is-a-segment-and-how-can-it-help-your-team-88hhzw/)). To specify this scenario for these two groups, we would create the following workflow:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/2e1f4e31-0513-489a-b89b-3c93a2d10550)

As you can see, the workflow starts with getting the user's message. We then determine the segment of the user and define the corresponding actions. Let's review creating this workflow step-by-step.

1. **Defining segments**

   There are multiple ways to define the segments (manually, via API, or other workflows and plugins). For the sake of simplicity, let's define them in the Crisp dashboard. Open your conversation, then find on the right side the section called "Segments for conversation" and add the "new" or "advanced" segment for your users:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/96838c5b-43e0-4760-a7ea-ba8b9bf5fb46)


   2. **Install the Crisp chatbot** 

This plugin is available for the "Unlimited" plan, you also can start with a free trial. To install the plugin, open your dashboard, click the Plugins on the left menu and select the Automation section, click the Bot plugin, and then click the install button.

   3. **Create the first scenario**

Click the *New scenario* button at the top of the plugin menu and you will see the following canvas with one entry point (gate):

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/7add8b0e-74e2-4cc0-b02f-b60796621271)


4. **Add a new event**
Firstly, we need to determine the segment our user belongs to. The very first event that happens when a user starts interaction is the message event. To add it, click on the plus of the entry point block, or the plus on the left side of the canvas, select the *New User Message* event and drag it to the canvas (while dragging the link to the first block is created automatically):

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/5c48ebb0-743c-4047-9f33-fe700a54f744)

5. **Add the first condition**

The very first condition we want to add will determine if the user just started the conversation (as we want to check it only once, at the beginning of the conversation). To add this block, click on the *Plus* again if you close it, then select the *Condition* block, and then click the *Conversation* type. Drag the *Conversation is new?* block onto the canvas:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/abd75177-d274-4f98-ac71-ec7a95400bea)

6. **Condition for our new clients**

  We want our new clients to be served by chatbot immediately but first, we need to determine their segment.  Add another condition block but this time the type is "Contact" and the block is "Contact Segments?":

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/58339256-0302-4146-86f4-eb360b020aad)

Then click on the block and you will see a menu over it, click the *Edit* button:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/0758ffc4-d9e1-4edb-92a7-cb75fc238ec8)

Leave the condition as is ("Contains any") and in the value input print "new":

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/16c72246-07f1-4cac-b774-400d80cc5a71)


8. **Send the signal to Enum**

We want our "new" users to be served by the Enum chatbot. To make it happen, we have to send the corresponding signal to the Enum. By default, the Enum chatbot starts working as soon as user sends the first message, and in the next section, we will show you how to change this behavior. Now, let's add the action block, then select the *Update User* type and block *Update Custom Data*

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/8574af27-77eb-4aa8-b4ed-3b4ea758e7d2)

In the left menu, enter the following data: key "enum" and value "start_chatbot", then press Enter to save changes.

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/fb2b94ab-6681-406e-b704-8aaf641d3ddf)


9. **Add an information message**

Immediately after you send the signal to the Enum chatbot, it will start working. You may add here the message that will inform the enum that the AI assistant started. Drag a new action block, select the "Send Message" type, then the "Send message" block. In the menu on the left, enter the corresponding message:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/5aa1ea57-d170-4e12-af09-3a9a3803f78e)


10. **Add the condition for advanced users**

Drag another condition block to the canvas, and select the Conversation segments block. In its properties enter the "advanced" value and press Enter to save changes. Then click to the beginning of the block and drag the connection to the "Conversation is new?" block:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/ead2588e-868f-4938-8b55-d6878713a5c3)

11. **Add the Buttons action**

From the left menu, drag a new Action (*Send Message*, *Add a button picker?*) block and connect it to the previous condition block:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/ac1fc99a-7ca2-4ad1-ae9e-09fe7028c179)

In the block's properties, enter the accompanying message, then click the *Add a button* and enter the button's text. 

12. **Add the button event block**

Now, we need to know whether the user clicks the chatbot button. Let's add the event (the *Button/Input Action* type) and connect it to the buttons' block:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/1bf601fb-9f78-43f9-91d5-903b4c1fcbba)

In the block's properties, select the *Button Click* as the message action, and *AI Support Assistant* in the *Match* dropdown. Selecting so, we are saying "We are moving to the next block if user clicked the AI Assistant Button".

13. **Activate the chatbot**

Drag from the left menu an Action block,  add the action block, then select the *Update User* type and block *Update Custom Data* and enter the following data: key "enum" and value "start_chatbot", then press Enter to save changes - exactly the same what we did in step 8:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/c0ded8e5-ba74-4952-abe9-7cf15a047ccc)


14. **Add the information message**

Add the *Action* block, type *Send message* to the end of this fork and type some information message:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/2fa19d99-dbdd-4de0-9fb1-e35b841c253b)


15. **Save and deploy your chatbot**

On the top menu of the chatbot editor, click the *Save* button

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/67ba9ad5-8f82-4e70-a9f2-23dd78dd02ec)

then the *Deploy*:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/25695327-d40a-42a6-8679-e3c32346a73a)


16. **Add the start settings in the Enum**
In the Enum dashboard, open your chatbot page, move to the *Custom behaviour & Automation* tab, then to the *Integration with Crisp chatbot workflow* section. Select the second option *Wait for signal from Crisp chatbot or the user to start* and click the *Save* button. Doing so, we say to the Enum chatbot "Do not start answering questions until you have a signal" and the signal will be updating "user data" which we did in the steps 8 and 

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/9ff76251-3f39-4370-9f34-c231259a41ec)

That's it!

17. **Test the chatbots integration**

You can test the workflow you've just created, right in the Enum dashboard. Move to the *Live test* tab of your chatbot's properties, then click the *Show Crisp chatbox button* and the Crisp button will be shown on the right pane. Then try to simulate the user's behavior to see the result.

<Callout>
  If you want to test the user when there is no assigned segment yet, try to use this hack:

1. Temporarily change the condition block where you determine the segment: instead of "Contains any" select "Doesn't contain any" value:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/e2a7bed1-4646-4304-ab04-54a3494a220b)

This condition will work for any user without an assigned segment.

2. Open the Enum dashboard in the browser's private window - it will create a new Crisp conversation (you will have to login again).

## List of commands that can be sent to Enum chatbot

### Values for buttons
You can assign buttons specific values that will be sent as soon as the user clicks on them. This approach can be used instead of setting *User Custom Data*:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/c9a2732f-5fa5-48ca-959a-bbfea86654ed)

Recognized values:

- enum:start_chatbot
- enum:pause_chatbot

### Values for User Custom Data:

- key: enum, value: start_chatbot
- key: enum, value: pause_chatbot
