# Chatbot plugin for Crisp 

## What is Crisp

[Crisp](https://crisp.chat) is the all-in-one business messaging platform that gathers teams, conversations, data and knowledge, around one place.

## What is the Support AI ChatBot plugin

We created this plugin to allow your users and visitors to ask questions on your website, your product, and any other materials and data without your participation.

Why is that so useful? There are several reasons:

1. You don't have to be before your computer 24/7
2. Our chatbot may answer the questions much faster than you would.
3. Our chatbot may answer the questions in more precise manner.
4. Our chatbot is based on ChatGPT (currently) so it's much, much smarter than usual chatbot is.

To run the chatbot you don't need to create a long, not-very-reliable workflows. All you need is just to register at [Enum](https://enumhq.com), create a new project, upload files, enter a plain text or/and scrap your own website. You also need to install this plugin, of course.

So, here is the full guide on installing and running your smart chatbot:
