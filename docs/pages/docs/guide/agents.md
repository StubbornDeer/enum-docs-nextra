# Agents

AI agents allow you to isolate the logic and data sources for performing different tasks. Suppose, we have the following problem: we need to separate access to data sources depending on the language the question was asked in. If the question was asked in English, we want the chatbot to look the answer in the data sources A and C, whereas if the question was asked in French, we want that chatbot only looks in the data source F. 
Another use case is "We want the chatbot behaves differently depending on the user - if he/she is already our client we want to use one prompt, and if not yet, another prompt".

Before introducing agents, it was not possible to separate the logic or/and data sources for different cases, now you can create scenarios covering many complex use cases.

  Please note that using Agents is not 100% reliable as it's controlled by the main prompt. It's the very first step to expand the chatbot possibilities but in some cases, the logic may not work.
