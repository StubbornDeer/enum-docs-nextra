We do not store your OpenAI key nor your password as a text. We encrypted them with SHA-256 algorithm which is almost impossible to crack.

## Create a project
A ***project*** is a place where you add the datasources of the same topics. For example, you may a separate project for your project, or a website, or a group of websites. Check [the corresponding page](https://www.enumhq.com/docs/guide/projects) for more details.

<Callout>
 **The important note** : we search the answer within a project only. Also, a user interface is linked to a project so is the linking to chatbot.
</Callout>

You may create as many projects as you want.
  <Callout>
While formally we do not restrict the number of projects you can create, we reserve the right to suspend or even block your account if we see that you are abusing the provided capabilities.
  </Callout>

You will be redirected to the project's page with an empty list of data sources.
 
## Add a data source
As soon as a project is created you may add the data source. A **data source** is the information to be indexed and searched by our engine. Read more on [the data source documentation page](https://www.enumhq.com/docs/guide/data-sources).

 Click the "Add a new source" button and then select the corresponding type of data sources:
