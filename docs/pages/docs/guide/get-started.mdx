We do not store your OpenAI key nor your password as a text. We encrypted them with SHA-256 algorithm which is almost impossible to crack.

## Create a project
A ***project*** is a place where you add the datasources of the same topics. For example, you may a separate project for your project, or a website, or a group of websites.

 **The important note** : we search the answer within a project only. Also, a user interface is linked to a project so is the linking to chatbot.

You may to have as many projects as you want.
  <Callout>
While formally we do not restrict the number of projects you can create, we reserve the right to suspend or even block your account if we see that you are abusing the provided capabilities.
