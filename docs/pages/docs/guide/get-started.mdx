If you already buy the "Key" plan, you can use the [Open AI Assistant](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8550641-assistants-api) or a standard ChatGPT enter OpenAI key here, you also can select a model.

<Callout>
OpenAI Assistant is a developed version of a normal ChatGPT dashboard where you can upload your own files and ask questions about them. When you select this option, we do not have any control over the prompts, data, and the quality of responses.
</Callout>

After you change your settings click the *Save settings* button.

  <Callout>
We do not store your OpenAI key or your password as a text. We encrypted them with SHA-256 algorithm which is almost impossible to crack.
  </Callout>

## Create a project
A *project* is a place where you add the data sources of the same topics. For example, you may have a separate project for your project, a website, or a group of websites. Check [the corresponding page](https://www.enumhq.com/docs/guide/projects) for more details.

<Callout>
 **The important note** : we search the answer within a project only. Also, a user interface is linked to a project so is the linking to chatbot.
</Callout>

You may create as many projects as you want.
  <Callout>
While formally we do not restrict the number of projects you can create, we reserve the right to suspend or even block your account if we see that you are abusing the provided capabilities.
  </Callout>
  
To add a new project, click the *My projects* menu item on the left menu bar, then click the *All projects* link and the *Add a project* button.

In the showing popup enter the name and description (optional), then click the *OK* button:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/441f62d0-164a-4dfe-922e-36dc4768f4ba)

You will be redirected to the project's page with an empty list of data sources.
 
## Add a data source
As soon as a project is created you may add the data source. A *data source* is a piece of information to be indexed and searched by our engine. Read more on [the data source documentation page](https://www.enumhq.com/docs/guide/data-sources).

 Click the "Add a new source" button and then select the corresponding type of data source:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/5407348c-fac1-4a47-b9a3-b15b9a90267a)

<Callout>
  At the moment, you can add data sources of 3 types: PDF file, plain text, or a website.
 </Callout>

After you select a file, click the *Add this source* button:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/75570050-c149-4443-ab92-b88d7d325a1b)

<Callout>
  If a file is big, the indexing (that is extracting the text, splitting it into pieces and saving it in our special database) can take some time. 
 </Callout>


After the process of indexing ends, the popup disappears and you will see the new data source with its status and the number of pages it has (you can read more on tokens [here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them)).

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/68a066d1-5124-41d7-9a9f-238a4c6154d3)

That's it! You can start asking questions about your documents.

### Ask questions in UI

then start a new chat:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/fd94cbf2-fd82-4fa0-baa2-de33bca1558e)

Every response is coming with the amount of spent tokens as well as the current model used for responding:

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/a3fd7abd-3a6e-4029-bb34-ae0cb59b6077)

<Callout>
  You can choose the model in the General settings (in the left menu) or in the project's settings.
 </Callout>

### Allow your users to ask questions - via a smart chatbot

If you already are using the [Crisp](https://crisp.chat) chat box for your website, you may consider adding a smart bot to your website to allow your users ask the questions when you are out of the office:

Please find the information on the installation and setup of the Crisp chatbot on the [corresponding section](https://www.enumhq.com/docs/chat-plugins/crisp/why).
