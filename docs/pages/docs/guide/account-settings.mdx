## Account settings

Here, you can change your settings. Those who bought a plan starting with the "Key-" word ("Key-10" or "Key-99"), can change their OpenAI key and select the model (GPT-4 and GPT4-Turbo are available on these plans besides the GPT-3 and some other, outdated but very cheap models).
