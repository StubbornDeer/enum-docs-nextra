# Data Sources

Data sources is the core of providing a smart access to your data. When you load any text information into the system, it reads the text, split into chunks, and upload in a special storage (currently, we user a vector database). When a user query comes, we looks in the datastore to find the most fitting chunks, and then pass them to the ChatGPT engine which looks for an answer and build a human-like response.

## Add a data source
As soon as a project is created you may add the data source. A *data source* is a piece of information to be indexed and searched by our engine. Read more on [the data source documentation page](https://www.enumhq.com/docs/guide/data-sources).

 Click the "Add a new source" button and then select the corresponding type of data sources:

<Callout>
  At the moment, you can add data sources of 3 types: PDF file, plain text, or a web site.
 </Callout>

Let's review all these datasource types.

### Plain text

Add a new source and select a plain text. Then paste into the window the previously copied text and click the *Add this source* button:

<Callout>
For a plain text, we can calculate the number of tokens before loading, for your information.

### PDF files
Select or drug one or more PDF files in the new datasource popup:

<Callout>
If you accidentally select a non-PDF file, it will be ignored.
</Callout>

### Web site
We can parse load the data from a website. The workflow of the process is:

1. You enter a website's URL
2. Our system crawls it and find all the links belonging to the same domain, excluding broken or private links.
3. You then may select which webpages to include into the indexing.

Let's see how it works:

1. We enter a website URL and click the "Start page indexing" what runs the crawler:

It launches the crawler:

<Callout>
If a website has multiple pages, the process of indexing can take some time.
</Callout>
2. 
Select/unselect pages for indexing. Use the "Check all" and "Uncheck all" if needed:

3. Click the "Add this source" button to start the indexing:

When a datasource is added successfully, you will see the green tick and amount of indexed tokens:
