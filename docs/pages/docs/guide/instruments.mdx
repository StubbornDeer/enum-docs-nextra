# Instruments®

Instruments® is a new way to use the chatbot. With Instruments®, your users may not only ask questions about your products but also get help with data that is out of the scope of your documentation. The examples of such interactions are (not limited to):

- ask for a parcel status
- connect to a third-party API and ask the chatbot to handle the obtained data
- connect to your inner API
- open any webpage on the Internet, read its content, and ask questions about it
- run a query against another project
- extract data from JSON.

Let's review how to install and use the simplest instrument to check the parcel's status.

<Steps>
  ### Install the instrument

  Open the instruments market page. It can be found on your project's menu:

You can check the details of the instrument by clicking the *Details* button:

### Disable/enable it

Now, if you open the *My instruments* page and click the details of your instrument, you can disable/enable it. It may be convenient if you want to keep an instrument but just prefer to switch it off temporarily:

  ### Ask a question about your parcel

Now, open your Interaction page or type right in your chatbox something like "What is status of my delivery?". The chatbot will ask you to provide your tracking number, after entering it you will know where your parcel is:
