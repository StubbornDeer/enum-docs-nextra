  Don't forget to add your project description to the instrument's settings! Even though the chatbot can work without them, but with this description, it's much more precise. Please find the information about this setting in the [corresponding article](https://www.enumhq.com/docs/guide/instruments/general-instruments-guide#provide-your-project-description).
