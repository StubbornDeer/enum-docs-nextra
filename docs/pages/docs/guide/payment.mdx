# The payment process
When you are satisfied with a free plan, you may consider moving to a paid plan to upload more documents and get more questions to be asked.
The process is very straightforward.
## Select a plan
Click the *Billing* menu item in the left menu, you will be redirected to the page with all available plans:

Select a plan you'd like to move and click the "Select this plan" button. You will be redirected to the Stripe payment page:

Click the *See details* to see all the plan's details. If you change your mind you can click the back button to return to the dashboard.

If you are a business and have to provide the tax information on checkout (like VAT number) please click the *I'm purchasing as a business* option and enter your data.

After you finish the payment process you will be returned to the dashboard and all the necessary data will be saved into our database, so your Billing page may look something like this:

## Move to another plan or cancel
If you decide to move to another plan, just click the *Select this plan* button. The previous subscription will be canceled and a new one will be created.
