# Projects

A project is a place where you add data sources of the same topics. For example, you may have a separate project for your project, a website, or a group of websites. 
 
## Add a new project
To add a new project, click the *My projects* menu item on the left menu bar, then click the *All projects* link and the *Add a project* button.

In the showing popup enter the name and description (optional), then click the *OK* button:

You will be redirected to the project's page with an empty list of data sources.

## Add a data source
As soon as a project is created you may add the data source. A *data source* is a piece of information to be indexed and searched by our engine. Read more on [the data source documentation page](https://www.enumhq.com/docs/guide/data-sources).

 Click the "Add a new source" button and then select the corresponding type of data sources:

<Callout>
  At the moment, you can add data sources of 3 types: PDF file, plain text, or a web site.
 </Callout>

## Project's settings
After a project is created you may edit some of its properties. For a given project, click the *Settings* link:

### General tab
Here you can change the project's name and its description.
The description is used when the project is shown on the Project list:

### AI Settings
The second tab has the AI tuning settings.

Let's review all the settings

#### ChatGPT Engine and OpenAI Model
Here you can select what to use for the generating responses: the OpenAI assistant, [a new technology that allows you to upload your own data right in the OpenAI dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/assistants), or a regular OpenAI chat model. If you use the second option, you can then select a model (the default model is ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo). The GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo are available.

<Callout>
  Please note that these options are available only for the "Key" plan. The reason is because ChatGPT assistant and ChatGPT-4 models are still very expensive, so you use them at your own risk.
</Callout>
<Callout>
  Don't forget to enter the OpenAI key which is available in the account's settings (can be found at the bottom of the left menu).
</Callout>

#### Custom prompt
This section has 2 options:
- the text of your custom prompt
- the switch to replace the default prompt (that one we use by default) with your prompt.

<Callout>
  Our default prompt is not only a piece of text but it's a combination of logic, code, and text. As it is our intellectual property, it can't be shared.
</Callout>

<Callout>
  Creating a good prompt could be tricky. But now we provided several pieces of advice, to read them please click the *Good prompts: tips & tricks* icon, and the side panel will be open.

Also, to help you with creating a good, working prompt, we wrote this article: [Art of Creating Great Prompts](https://enumhq.com/blog/posts/art-of-creating-great-prompts/).

#### Custom messages

Here you can enter messages as a guide for the chatbot on what to say when it doesn't know an answer, and when is asked for human assistance.

<Callout>
  You can set up these messages that will be used in all your chatbots for the current project unless you provide the same messages for a separate chatbot which has a higher priority.
</Callout>

#### Fine tuning

These settings are used for the fine-tuning data to be passed to ChatGPT as context.

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/fbb21915-aac0-4121-b205-dae197848f28)

- chunk size is the amount of bytes to be stored and to be obtained from the index database to form context data (the default number is 256 bytes which usually works great but in some cases, other amount, say, 1024 bytes works better)
- amount of chunks to send as context - the number of pieces that will be sent as context. The more the number the better but sometimes it can be more that the OpenAI threshold what can cause an error.


### Using metadata
You now can add metadata in the prompt, currently, the language of the question is available. If you want the chatbot to answer always in the language of question (that is detected automatically), use the following syntax:

```
... Answer in the {language} language.
```

Just add the "language" word wrapped with curly brackets, and then, during the preprocessing of your prompt, it will be converted into a normal string (the exact value varies according to the question's language):

```
... Answer in the French language.
```

## Deleting project
If you scroll down to the end of the settings page you will see the "danger zone":

![image](https://github.com/StubbornDeer/enum-docs-nextra/assets/91156314/61854521-efd4-4eb1-9abc-4e71ccff992e)

Click the *Delete project* button if you'd like to delete a project but be aware that all the associated data sources as well as interactions will be deleted too.
