# Projects

A project is a place where you add data sources of the same topics. For example, you may have a separate project for your project, a website, or a group of websites. 

## Add a new project
To add a new project, click the *My projects* menu item on the left menu bar, then click the *All projects* link and the *Add a project* button.

In the showing popup enter the name and description (optional), then click the *OK* button:

You will be redirected to the project's page with an empty list of data sources.

## Add a data source
As soon as a project is created you may add the data source. A *data source* is a piece of information to be indexed and searched by our engine. Read more on [the data source documentation page](https://www.enumhq.com/docs/guide/data-sources).

 Click the "Add a new source" button and then select the corresponding type of data sources:

  At the moment, you can add data sources of 3 types: PDF file, plain text, or a web site.

## Project's settings
After a project is created you may edit some its properties. For a given project, click the *Settings* link:

The second tab has the AI tuning settings.

Here you can change:

- project's name
- project's description
- the OpenAI key
- the ChatGPT model
- custom prompt and its setting.

The custom prompt you enter here will be available in both: interaction and the chatbot. If you leave the "Replace the default prompt" switch unchecked, your prompt will be added to our default prompt, else it will be fully replaced.

<Callout>
Please note, that using your own OpenAI key and AI models (including GPT-4) are available only for the "Key" plan.
</Callout>

<Callout>
  If you specify both models - in the General settings and for a project, the project model is prevalent.
</Callout>

## Deleting project
If you scroll down to the end of the settings page you will see the "danger zone":

Click the *Delete project* button if you'd like to delete a project but be aware that all the associated data sources as well as interactions will be deleted too.
