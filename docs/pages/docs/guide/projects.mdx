You will be redirected to the project's page with an empty list of data sources.

## Add a data source
As soon as a project is created you may add the data source. A *data source* is a piece of information to be indexed and searched by our engine. Read more on [the data source documentation page](https://www.enumhq.com/docs/guide/data-sources).

 Click the "Add a new source" button and then select the corresponding type of data sources:
