# Support and feedback
If you have questions, please try to ask our chatbot first. It can be found on the main page, works 24/7 and glad to help you whatever issue it is.
If the chatbot can't help and an issue is urgent, please request the human assistance (in the chatbox) or write us at info@enumhq.com.

<Callout>
  Please note, we are a small team located in the MDT zone (Canada, Edmonton) so if you are located, say, in Asia, we probably can't respond immediately. But we usually try to resolve all the issues as soon as we wake up.

If you have a non-urgent question, you found a bug, or would like to request a feature, please visit our feedback board and create a new post there:
